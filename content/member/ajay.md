Ajay Uppili Arasanipalai is a student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. In 2019, He achieved state of the art results on the Stanford DAWNBench competition, where the goal is to reduce the time and cost to train convolutional networks. Currently, Ajay is working with the BH PIRE group on building models for physical parameter extraction from black hole images obtained from general relativity simulations. He is now co-authoring a book on applied natural language processing with transformers that will be published by Oâ€™Reilly Media in summer 2021.
