I am currently majoring in Computer Science and Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay. My research interests are somewhat in the intersection of Image Processing, Compressed Sensing, Theoretical Deep Learning and Causal Statistics. Recently, I have been enjoying reading about the interesting design decisions in Graph Neural Networks! I am always on the lookout for exciting research, so do drop by if you want to have a discussion!

Previously, I've had the opportunity to work with some excellent mentors! I recently worked with <a href="https://ni.cs.univie.ac.at/"><b>Neuroinformatics Lab of Universit√§t Wien</b></a> to understand the viability of kernel-based approaches for non-linear causal clustering. In the past, I've worked with <a href="http://ujwalgadiraju.com/"><b>Prof. Ujwal Gadiraju</b></a> of <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/en/"><b>TU Delft</b></a>, Netherlands, on Crowd Computing and Human-Centered AI. I also spent an awesome time working with <a href="https://people.iitgn.ac.in/~shanmuga/"> <b>Prof. Shanmuganathan Raman</b></a> of <a href="https://iitgn.ac.in/"><b>CVIG Lab, IIT Gandhinagar</b></a>, Gujarat to tackle the major oversmoothing and interpretability problems in Deep GCNs.

If I am not in front of my laptop, you'll probably find me with my Guitar, Camera or some Murakami Novel.
