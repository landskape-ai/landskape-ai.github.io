I'm a senior at the Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati, majoring in Mathematics and Computing. I'm heavily inclined towards the theoretical aspects of deep learning and the math behind the algorithms. I have previously worked in the fields of Data-Driven Discovery of Integral-Differential Equations, Non-Convex Optimization and Attention Mechanisms in Vision. I'm currently working on the application of Reinforcement Learning in a medical setting, along with more fundamental research topics such as Activation Functions and Optimization methods.

In my free time you would catch me either playing or watching football or reading up on detailed post-match analyses on twitter.
