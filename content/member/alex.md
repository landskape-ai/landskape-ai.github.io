Alex recently graduated from MIT with a BS in EECS and will continue his MEng at MIT next year. Last summer, he did an engineering internship at Facebook, where he built an end-to-end ML model as part of the Advertiser Integrity team. He has also done research in robustness and optimization while at MIT. His current research interests include theory for deep learning, robustness/interpretability, continual learning, and the intersection between PL and ML.
