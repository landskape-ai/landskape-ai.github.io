During my career I have blended scientific, technical and artistic areas in projects and ventures around the world, from Silicon Valley to the jungles of Bali, and spoken about those ventures and related work at institutions like Stanford University and UC Berkeley, the United Nations FAO HQ, the financial center of London, the International Cultural Diplomacy Conference in Berlin and many others. I consider deep learning a key opportunity to transform our world and make it a better place, looking towards a future in which human beings can have "más tiempo para lo más humano", more time for what truly makes us human, for those things we really enjoy. Within deep learning I am passionate about blending the research and technical side of A.I with the creative arts in order to produce high quality visualizations of deep learning optimization processes that can both inspire and help trigger new insights. It is a mission to bring a sense of beauty to A.I, combining rigurious research with very high resolution and quality visualizations that can bring new light and perspective onto some of the mysteries of deep learning training processes. I also do work and research on A.I related projects in different areas with an emphasis at the moment on computer vision, and I'm leading as well different projects related to innovation management, augmented & mixed reality and other cutting edge areas that blend tech with the creative fields.
It is a pleasure to be part of this great group as we work together to unlock the mysteries that lie ahead.
