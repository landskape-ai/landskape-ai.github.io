## Abstract

In this work, we propose the first progressive denoising framework inspired from the ALMA framework. In addition, we propose a new metric for evaluating the anytime performance of reconstruction models in the ALMA framework. Furthermore, we analyse and investigate the different effects of changing the scale of progressive noise and the size of the megabatches with respect to the final and the anytime performance.
